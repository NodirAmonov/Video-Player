# Video-Player


 **This was another neat little project for the course. I don't really have too much to talk about on this one honestly.
 It is a basic video player that plays the one video I supplied.
 There is fullscreen functionality, volume & mute, playback speed, and play and pause.
 I can see how this project could be expanded even more to basically make a YouTube clone. 
 I think that that is an ambitious project though! Could be something interesting for me to do in the future.
